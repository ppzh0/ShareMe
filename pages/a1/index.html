            <h1>What is <br> Microsoft Visual C++</h1>
            <p>
                Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) is a compiler for the C, C++ and C++/CX programming languages by Microsoft. MSVC is
                proprietary software; it was originally a standalone product but later became a part of Visual Studio and made
                available in both trialware and freeware forms. It features tools for developing and debugging C++ code, especially
                code written for the Windows API, DirectX and .NET.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many applications require redistributable Visual C++ runtime library packages to function correctly. These packages
                are often installed independently of applications, allowing multiple applications to make use of the package while
                only having to install it once. These Visual C++ redistributable and runtime packages are mostly installed for
                standard libraries that many applications use.
